\title{Break a raster into overlapped tiles using a predefined tiling scheme}
\usage{
tile_rast(r, make_tiles, out_dir, clear_dir = FALSE, progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{\code{SpatRaster} to be broken into tiles.}

\item{make_tiles}{A list returned by \code{\link[=make_tiles]{make_tiles()}}, containing at minimum
\code{cs_tiles} (interior tile polygons), \code{tile_num} (integer tile IDs),
and \code{overlap_cells} (overlap width in cells).}

\item{out_dir}{Directory where \code{.asc} tiles will be written. If \code{NULL},
tiles are written to a temporary directory for the current R session.}

\item{clear_dir}{Logical; if \code{FALSE} (default) and \code{out_dir} is not empty,
the function stops rather than overwriting existing files. If \code{TRUE},
existing files in \code{out_dir} are removed before writing tiles.}

\item{progress}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, a text progress bar is displayed while
tiles are written.}
}
\value{
A named list with:
\item{asc_dir}{Absolute path to the directory where \code{.asc} tiles were written.}
}
\description{
This function takes a \code{SpatRaster} and a tiling scheme created by \code{\link[=make_tiles]{make_tiles()}}
and writes out overlapped raster tiles for use with ConScape. The tiling layout
(interior tile footprints and overlap width) is defined entirely by \code{make_tiles},
ensuring consistent alignment across rasters and with the landmark grid used for
coarse graining.
}
\details{
For each interior tile polygon in \code{make_tiles$cs_tiles}, the function expands
the extent by \code{make_tiles$overlap_cells} on all sides (in units of raster
cells), crops the extended raster (\code{extend()} is called once on \code{r} using the
same overlap), and writes the result as an ESRI ASCII grid with filenames of
the form \code{"r_<tile_id>.asc"}. Because the tiling scheme is generated in cell
space by \code{\link[=make_tiles]{make_tiles()}}, multiple rasters tiled with the same \code{make_tiles}
object share identical tile boundaries and overlap, which is required for
consistent landmark placement in ConScape coarse graining.
